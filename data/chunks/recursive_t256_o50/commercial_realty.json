During the past year, our manager has continued to make progress on the core tenets of its responsibilities to manage the existing assets in the portfolio, originate new loan assets, facilitate the financing of the assets, and control costs to drive earnings and increase book value per share. We are pleased to report that substantial progress has been made on all fronts and we remain focused on these mandates going forward.\n\nThe ACRES team continued to diligently manage our assets and provide exceptional service for our borrowers. We worked proactively with these borrowers to address their needs so that they could maintain payments on their loans. These efforts have resulted in a high-quality, stabilized book to build on.\n\nWe are proud of the success we achieved in 2022 and are optimistic in our ability to deliver shareholder value over the long term.\n\nSelective Growth & Attractive Financing Vehicles\n\nDuring 2022, we selectively grew the Company’s loan portfolio by leveraging ACRES’s complementary lending pipeline and network of sponsor relationships. We are pleased to note that we closed over $610 million of commercial real estate first-mortgage commitments in 202",

We expect that these investments may yield enhanced returns in the long term that, we will be able to substantially shield from taxes due to the existence of ACR’s considerable tax assets and ultimately reinvest into the loan origination pipeline.\n\nWe recognize that building on this momentum is essential. Therefore, the ACRES team is vigilant in identifying and executing on opportunities to grow asset-specific financing with duration at attractive coupon rates that can raise our capacity to originate loans. In addition, we have the reinvestment window available on our two ACR securitizations through May 2023 and December 2023. The bulk of the Company’s current portfolio was originated in 2021 and 2022, comprising 84% of the current par balance and have initial maturities of 2024 or later and extended maturities of 2026 or later.\n\nPortfolio Stability\n\nThe ACRES asset management team prides itself on its ability to tailor solutions that will keep borrowers on track despite challenges that may arise.

Additionally, 89% of the par value of our floating-rate loan portfolio was covered by borrower- owned interest rate caps that provided additional credit protection to the Company in the current rising interest rate environment.\n\nCapital Markets Flexibility\n\nWe worked closely with our lenders and executed as planned to provide the Company maximum flexibility given the challenging business environment in 2022.\n\nWe finalized terms with Mass Mutual under its non-mark-to-market agreement to upsize the commitment and to provide for individual loan series that will each have a five-year term from the date of issuance.

Additionally, early in 2023, we announced a partnership with Project Destined, an organization that provides training in financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and real estate to students from underserved communities.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs we look ahead to 2023, we have established a goal to get the Company fully invested to drive meaningful earnings that can be re-invested back into the loan origination pipeline.

The resulting spread of COVID-19 throughout the globe led the World Health Organization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S, to declare national emergencies. Many countries responded to the initial and ensuing outbreaks of COVID-19 by instituting quarantines and restrictions on travel and limiting operations of non-essential offices and retail centers, which resulted in the closure or remote operation of non-essential businesses and increased rates of unemployment and market disruption in connection with the economic uncertainty.

In such event, existing credit support relating to the securities’ structure may not be sufficient to protect us against loss of our principal. For additional risks regarding real estate-related loans, see “Risks Related to Investments- Our commercial mortgage loans and mezzanine loans are subject to the risks inherent in owning the real estate securing or underlying those investments that could result in losses to us.”\n\n25\n\nOur investments in preferred equity involve a greater risk of loss than traditional first mortgage debt investments we make.\n\nWe may make preferred equity investments in entities that own or acquire CRE properties.

The Maryland Act defines “control shares” as voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power: one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one- third or more but less than a majority, or a majority or more of all voting power.

The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stock of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends to which more favorable rates apply, which could reduce the value of the stocks of REITs. However, under the TCJA, regular dividends from REITs are treated as income from a pass-through entity and are eligible for a 20% deduction. As a result, our regular dividends are taxed at 80% of an individual’s marginal tax rate. The current maximum rate is 37% resulting in a maximum tax rate of 29.6%.

The resulting spread of COVID-19 throughout the globe led the World Health Organization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S, to declare national emergencies.

In order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio, we utilize our full, 16 year underwriting history in the determination of historical losses, along with the market loss history from a selected population from an engaged third-party provider’s database that were similar to our loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general LTV profiles.\n\nCredit risk profiles of CRE loans, at amortized cost, were as follows (in thousands, except amounts in the footnote):",

We generally utilize the following five types of\n\nfinancing arrangements:\n\n1. Senior Secured Financing Facility: Our senior secured financing facility allows us to borrow against loans and real estate investments that we own. This facility has an individual floating rate loan series structure that have a three month commitment period after the financing is approved by the lender, subject to the maximum dollar amount agreed upon for the series. Each floating rate loan series will have mutually agreed upon terms including (i) total commitment, including the capacity to fund future funding commitments, where applicable; (ii) advance rate on portfolio assets; (iii) interest rate composed of one-month Term SOFR plus a market rate spread; and (iv) maturity date of five years from the issuance date for the loan series unless an additional time is mutually agreed upon by the parties. The facility has a maximum portfolio LTV of 85% and contains customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type of financing arrangement.",

Term Warehouse Financing Facilities (CRE loans): Term warehouse financing facilities effectively allow us to borrow against loans that we own. Under these agreements, we transfer loans to a counterparty and agree to purchase the same loans from the counterparty at a price equal to the transfer price plus interest. The counterparty retains the sole discretion over both whether to purchase the loan from us and, subject to certain conditions, the collateral value of such loan for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty. Generally, if the lender determines (subject to certain conditions) that the value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a defined minimum amount, we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of (i) the revised collateral or market value multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. During the term of these agreements, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans and pay interest to the counterparty.",

Securitizations: We seek non-recourse long-term financing from securitizations of our investments in CRE loans. The securitizations generally involve a senior portion of our loan but may involve the entire loan. Securitization generally involves transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which then issues one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes are secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non-recourse notes. Securitizations of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate interest in any particular overall loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would, therefore, absorb all losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses with respect to the loan in question.",

The reinvestment feature of the securitizations will allow us to extend the securitizations’ financing capability by increasing the useful lives of the senior notes through the reinvestment of loan proceeds into new loans.

The CECL model requires us to make significant judgments, including: (i) the selection of a reasonable and supportable forecast period, (ii) the selection and weighting of appropriate macroeconomic forecast scenarios, (iii) projections for the amounts and timing of future fundings of committed balances and prepayments on CRE investments, (iv) the determination of the risk characteristics in which to pool financial assets, and (v) the appropriate historical loss data to use in the model. Unfunded commitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are unconditionally cancellable by us.",

The equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests, and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest.\n\nIn determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company reviews governing contracts, formation documents and any other contractual arrangements for any relevant terms and determines the activities that have the most significant impact on the VIE and who has the power to direct those activities.

When a loan is placed on non-accrual, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed from interest income.\n\nThe Company utilizes the contractual life of its loans to estimate the period over which it measures expected credit losses. Estimates for prepayments and extensions are incorporated into the inputs for the Company’s CECL model. Modifications to loan terms, such as a modification in connection with a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”), where a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, may result in the extension of the loan’s life and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) concurred with a joint statement of federal and state banking regulators that eased the requirements to classify a modification as a TDR if the modification was granted in connection with the effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic. If the concession granted on a TDR can only be captured through a discounted cash flow analysis, then the Company will individually assess the loan for expected credit losses using the discounted cash flow method.",

The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or, if quoted prices are not available, through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment. The hierarchy defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets",

In situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable, for example, when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period, unobservable inputs may be used.\n\nThe level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter; depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter.
